    <td>What we did in lesson</td>
    <td>This lesson was mainly spent setting up (or configuring) our blogs. We had to fork a file from github and then we were able customize our blogs, changing the background, the font and colours etc. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What went wrong?</td>
    <td>I had a massive problem that carried over to the beginning of the second lesson. I didn't have a working blog, and even though everything seemed to be perfect, it wouldnâ€™t load. In the next lesson i discovered that it was because i forgot to add a hyphen in my search, thus giving me the wrong file to fork.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What can i learn from it</td>
    <td>Check every minute detail, a small hitch can overturn the entire file, and a problem, no matter how small, is still a problem and should be focussed on.</td>
